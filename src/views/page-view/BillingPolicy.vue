            2. The administrator offers premium services such as Boost Plans and
            Top Ads Promo packages. If you order a Boost Plan, your
            announcements will be raised overall free offers. They will be
            displayed on all pages of a column, a section, or a region. Top
            announcements are placed in a separate block over the ordinary
            announcements. Detailed information on the duration, price, payment
            methods and other conditions of premium services are available at:

            announcement. If you use a mobile application, you should visit
            “Premium Services” section in your Profile or choose a preferred
            premium service while creating an announcement.</span

          <span

            by card, bank transfer or eWallet, you will be redirected to the
            checkout page of a relevant payment processor. All data entered by
            you on payment screens will be secured. The administrator will only
            receive information that relates to the payment. If you choose to
            pay by cash, you will receive payment details, which you can present
