                Conduct a background check on the company before going for an
                interview and also verify its website. Do not submit any upfront
                fees for a job application or go for interview in remote or
                unfamiliar places. There should be no sharing personal details
                such as bank account number or copy of your ID.

                  Avoid anyone who asks for extra fee to buy or sell an item or
                  service. Ibommarket never requests payment for its basic
                  services and does not allow items that are not located in
                  Nigeria, so import and brokage fee should never be
                  required.</span

                  Services such as Western Union or MoneyGram are not meant for
                  transactions between strangers and many scams are run through
                  them. Avoid such requests
